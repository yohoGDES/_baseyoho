<h2>Yoho Base Theme (Codekit Version)</h2>

<h4>Description:</h4>

<hr />

<p>This is a first build of my pre-built easy to roll SASS/Codekit/Wordpress theme.</p>

<p>Yoho Base is a custom, bare-bones WordPress theme designed and managed in an effort to improve workflow and better accommodate local development of WordPress projects. A great deal of the code for this theme has come from HTML5 Boilerplate. This theme has been configured to use Grunt as the task manager required to execute the compilations necessary for building site script and style files.</p>
